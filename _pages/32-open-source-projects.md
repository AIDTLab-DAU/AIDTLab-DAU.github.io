## Graph Neural Networks and Graph Transformers

### CGT, A Novel Graph Transformer Model for Mitigating Degree Biases in Message Passing Mechanism

* **Description:** We present CGT, a novel Graph Transformer model specialised in mitigating degree biases in Message Passing mechanism. We utilize community structures to address node degree biases in message-passing (MP) via learnable graph augmentations and novel graph transformers. Recent augmentation-based methods showed that MP neural networks often perform poorly on low-degree nodes, leading to degree biases due to a lack of messages reaching low-degree nodes. Despite their success, most methods use heuristic or uniform random augmentations, which are non-differentiable and may not always generate valuable edges for learning representations. In this paper, we propose Community-aware Graph Transformers, namely CGT, to learn degree-unbiased representations based on learnable augmentations and graph transformers by extracting within community structures. We first design a learnable graph augmentation to generate more within-community edges connecting low-degree nodes through edge perturbation. Second, we propose an improved self-attention to learn underlying proximity and the roles of nodes within the community. Third, we propose a self-supervised learning task that could learn the representations to preserve the global graph structure and regularize the graph augmentations. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets showed CGT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and significantly improves the node degree biases.

### UGT, A Novel Graph Transformer Model for Unifying Local and Global Graph Structural Features

* **Description:** Over the past few years, graph neural networks and graph transformers have been successfully used to analyze graph-structured data, mainly focusing on node classification and link prediction tasks. However, the existing studies mostly only consider local connectivity while ignoring long-range connectivity and the roles of nodes. We propose Unified Graph Transformer Networks (UGT) that effectively integrate local and global structural information into fixed-length vector representations. UGT learns local structure by identifying the local substructures and aggregating features of the k-hop neighborhoods of each node. We construct virtual edges, bridging distant nodes with structural similarity to capture the long-range dependencies. UGT learns unified representations through self-attention, encoding structural distance and p-step transition probability between node pairs. Furthermore, we propose a self-supervised learning task that effectively learns transition probability to fuse local and global structural features, which could then be transferred to other downstream tasks. Experimental results on real-world benchmark datasets over various downstream tasks showed that UGT significantly outperformed baselines that consist of state-of-the-art models. In addition, UGT reaches the third-order Weisfeiler-Lehman power to distinguish non-isomorphic graph pairs.

### LiteralKG, A Novel GNN Model for Learning Literal-aware Representations of Medical Knowledge Graphs

* **Description:** Over the past few years, Knowledge Graph (KG) embedding has been used to benefit the diagnosis of animal diseases by analyzing electronic medical records (EMRs), such as notes and veterinary records. However, learning representations to capture entities and relations with literal information in KGs is challenging as the KGs show heterogeneous properties and various types of literal information. Meanwhile, the existing methods mostly aim to preserve graph structures surrounding target nodes without considering different types of literals, which could also carry significant information. We propose **LiteralKG**, a knowledge graph embedding model for efficiently diagnosing animal diseases, which could learn various types of literal information and graph structure and fuse them into unified representations. Specifically, we construct a knowledge graph that is built from EMRs along with literal information collected from various animal hospitals. We then fuse different types of entities and node feature information into unified vector representations through gate networks. Finally, we propose a self-supervised learning task to learn graph structure in pretext tasks and then towards various downstream tasks. Experimental results on link prediction tasks demonstrate that our model outperforms the baselines that consist of state-of-the-art models.

### CART, A Novel Kiosk Recommendation System for Offline Retail Environment

* **Description:** Over the years, Recommendation systems have been widely employed across diverse tasks to offer hyperpersonalized services considering usersâ€™ unique preferences and past behaviors. However, existing recommendation systems may be less suited for edge-computing settings because of their high computational costs and numerous parameters. In this work, we propose a novel kiosk recommendation system (CART) that involves (i) self-supervised learning based on contextual information in offline retail environments and (ii) representation learning of user behaviors based on contextual information. The proposed model uses self-supervised learning to learn user propensity, contextual information, and domain attributes from offline retail. We propose three selfsupervised learning tasks: (i) learning user propensity through transactions, (ii) learning domain characteristics through item purchases, and (iii) learning contextual information through user propensity and behavior. After pre-training with the three tasks, the proposed model was fine-tuned to focus on specific user behaviors based on contextual information. We also evaluated the quality of items recommended by the proposed kiosk recommendation system using the transactions of a real kiosk system. As a result, MAP@3 was improved by 29.1% compared to the existing recommendation system.

### Connector, A Novel Unified Framework for Graph Representation Learning

* **Description:** We present Connector, a comprehensive graph representation learning framework developed primarily in Python using the PyTorch library. Connector Ver. 0.5 is a test release that will be further developed to enable researchers from different fields to apply graph representation learning models to their research. Connector consists of three main modules: graph data loaders, base model and graph representation learning modules. The graph loader modules introduce four graph loaders, namely homogeneous, heterogeneous, signed graph and knowledge graph loaders, which allow researchers to easily handle different types of graphs. By loading graph data, researchers can build and manipulate datasets with different file structures. The base model module includes different types of neural network layers, aggregators and sampling techniques for graphs to build common tasks such as loading models and loading/saving parameters.
