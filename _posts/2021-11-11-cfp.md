> Call for Papers of the 3rd International Conference on Human-centered Artificial Intelligence (Computing4Human 2022)

Aims and Scope
------------

The 3rd international conference on human-centered artificial intelligence (Computing4Human) will be held in Hanoi, Vietnam by International School, Vietnam National University, Hanoi and other partners. Computing4Human began initially under the international workshop on computational humanities and social sciences in 2020 and has extended to general artificial intelligence (AI) applications in 2021. At the last event, we have gathered studies for smart infrastructure, smart healthcare, secure and green IoT (Internet-of-Things), explainable recommendation and retrieval systems, and business intelligence, which are AI applications closely related to citizens’ everyday lives, besides computational humanities and social sciences studies. This year, we will pay more attention to AI applications that can improve citizens’ life qualities, such as smart city, smart governance, smart healthcare. In addition, we will also expand our focus on computing with an eye on new trends in the business world.

In the last year, we have focused on AI applications’ possibilities and social/economic effects rather than AI models and methodologies underlying the applications. However, most user-intimate AI applications are based on analysis and processing of the flooding of unstructured data, which has various requirements, such as privacy awareness. Therefore, this year’s event attempts to cover both the applications and fundamental AI methodologies. From the perspective of data analysis, semi- and self-supervised learning studies are welcomed to handle the lack of labeled data. Furthermore, multi-modal data analysis studies are necessary to obtain accurate analysis from the massive data in various modalities. Also, efficient and secure IoT systems are significant to manage large-scale data. Thereby, Computing4Human 2022 will cover diverse research areas from theoretical analysis, via AI methodologies, to application systems in all aspects of human life and business.

We founded the following regular tracks to introduce the various domains of human-centered AI applications:
*	Computational Humanities and Social Sciences
*	Smart Infrastructure
*	Smart Healthcare
*	Secure and Green IoT Communications
*	Explainable Recommendation and Retrieval
*	Business Intelligence
*	Digital Transformation in Business
*	E-Logistics

Papers related to the above-mentioned domains using cross-disciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches are encouraged and welcomed. This event has interested in every attempt to improve the life quality of human beings using AI. Therefore, we do not restrict potential submissions which do not totally fit in the regular tracks.

Submissions
------------

We invite the following two kinds of papers: 
*	Research papers (Maximum 7 pages excluding references)
*	Position papers and demos (Maximum 5 pages excluding references)

All manuscripts have to be formatted according to the LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) template.
All the manuscripts must be submitted in PDF files through the EasyChair system.
Also, authors have to annotate tracks that they aim at on the keyword list in the EasyChair system (not on keywords in manuscripts), e.g., '[Smart Healthcare]' and so on.
