[Sangmyeong Lee](https://nslab-cuk.github.io/member/sangmyeong) will leave our lab to join Hanyang University as an M.Eng. course student. He joined NS Lab last September. During the last three months, he has participated in ongoing studies and events in our lab and impressed all the lab members despite the short period. Although he needed more background knowledge on artificial intelligence and computer science and engineering at the beginning, he overcame it based on his diligence and inquisitive mind. Finally, he significantly contributed to our lab's ongoing research for the medical knowledge graph. 

His good nature will lead him to build a stellar record of accomplishment anywhere he is. Congratulations on his successful beginning as a scholar. 


Bon Voyage, Sangmyeong!! :tada:
