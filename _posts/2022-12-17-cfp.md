> Call for Papers of the 4th International Conference on Human-centered Artificial Intelligence (Computing4Human 2023)

Aims and Scope
------------

We are pleased to announce the 4th International Conference on Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (Computing4Human 2023), to be held in Hanoi, Vietnam, hosted by the International School, Vietnam National University, Hanoi, and other esteemed partners. Building upon the success of the previous event, Computing4Human 2022, this year's conference aims to delve deeper into AI applications that enhance the quality of life for citizens, such as smart cities, smart governance, and smart healthcare.

In addition to exploring the possibilities and social and economic impacts of AI applications, this year's conference also aims to cover fundamental AI methodologies, including semi- and self-supervised learning, multi-modal data analysis, and efficient and secure IoT systems. These approaches are crucial for accurately analyzing and processing the vast amount of unstructured data that underlies many user-intimate AI applications, while also taking into account privacy concerns.

To this end, we have established several regular tracks, including computational humanities and social sciences, smart infrastructure, smart healthcare, secure and green IoT communications, explainable recommendation and retrieval systems, business intelligence, digital transformation in business, and e-logistics. We welcome papers that utilize cross-disciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches to address the diverse range of topics related to human-centered AI applications.

At Computing4Human 2023, we are committed to improving the quality of life for all through the responsible and ethical application of artificial intelligence. As such, we are open to submissions that may not fit perfectly within our regular tracks, but demonstrate a dedication to this goal.

Submissions
------------

We invite the following two kinds of papers:

All manuscripts have to be formatted according to the LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) template.
All the manuscripts must be submitted in PDF files through the EasyChair system.
Also, authors have to annotate tracks that they aim at on the keyword list in the EasyChair system (not on keywords in manuscripts), e.g., '[Smart Healthcare]' and so on.
