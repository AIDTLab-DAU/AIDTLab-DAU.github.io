We present [CGT](https://github.com/NSLab-CUK/Community-aware-Graph-Transformer), a novel Graph Transformer model specialised in mitigating degree biases in Message Passing mechanism and developed by NS Lab, CUK based on pure PyTorch backend.

We utilize community structures to address node degree biases in message-passing (MP) via learnable graph augmentations and novel graph transformers. Recent augmentation-based methods showed that MP neural networks often perform poorly on low-degree nodes, leading to degree biases due to a lack of messages reaching low-degree nodes. Despite their success, most methods use heuristic or uniform random augmentations, which are non-differentiable and may not always generate valuable edges for learning representations. In this paper, we propose Community-aware Graph Transformers, namely **CGT**, to learn degree-unbiased representations based on learnable augmentations and graph transformers by extracting within community structures. We first design a learnable graph augmentation to generate more within-community edges connecting low-degree nodes through edge perturbation. Second, we propose an improved self-attention to learn underlying proximity and the roles of nodes within the community. Third, we propose a self-supervised learning task that could learn the representations to preserve the global graph structure and regularize the graph augmentations. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets showed **CGT** outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and significantly improves the node degree biases.


## A short description of CGT:

- We propose the utilization of within-community structures in learnable augmentations to allow low-degree nodes to be sampled with high probabilities via edge perturbation.
- We propose a novel graph transformer with improved self-attention that takes the augmented graph as input and encodes the within-community proximity into dot product self-attention and the roles of nodes. It is worth noting that we directly encode the high-order proximity into full dot product attention, which could enable **CGT** to discover the proximity information along with messages from neighborhoods to target nodes.
- We propose a self-supervised learning task to preserve graph connectivity and regularize the augmented graph data to generate the representations.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines on benchmark datasets and improves degree fairness.
