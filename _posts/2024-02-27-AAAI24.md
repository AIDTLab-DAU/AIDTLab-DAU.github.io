Our team member, [Van Thuy Hoang](https://nslab-cuk.github.io/member/hoangvanthuy90), presented his paper, which is titled "Transitivity-Preserving Graph Representation Learning for Bridging Local Connectivity and Role-based Similarity" and depicts his novel graph transformer model called "[Unified Graph Transformer](https://github.com/NSLab-CUK/Unified-Graph-Transformer)," at [the 38th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2024)](https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/). This recognition demonstrated his dedication and expertise in graph learning.
