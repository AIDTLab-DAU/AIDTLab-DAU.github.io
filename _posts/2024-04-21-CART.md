We present [CART](https://github.com/NSLab-CUK/Context-Aware-Residual-Transformer), a novel transformer-based recommendation system specialised in offline retail environment and developed by  a collaboration between [NS Lab, CUK](https://nslab-cuk.github.io/) and [IIP Lab, Gachon University](http://iiplab.gachon.ac.kr/)  based on pure [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) backend.

Over the years, Recommendation systems have been widely employed across diverse tasks to offer hyperpersonalized services considering usersâ€™ unique preferences and past behaviors. However, existing recommendation systems may be less suited for edge-computing settings because of their high computational costs and numerous parameters. In this work, we propose a novel kiosk recommendation system (**CART**) that involves (i) self-supervised learning based on contextual information in offline retail environments and (ii) representation learning of user behaviors based on contextual information. The proposed model uses self-supervised learning to learn user propensity, contextual information, and domain attributes from offline retail. We propose three selfsupervised learning tasks: (i) learning user propensity through transactions, (ii) learning domain characteristics through item purchases, and (iii) learning contextual information through user propensity and behavior. After pre-training with the three tasks, the proposed model was fine-tuned to focus on specific user behaviors based on contextual information. We also evaluated the quality of items recommended by the proposed kiosk recommendation system using the transactions of a real kiosk system. As a result, MAP@3 was improved by 29.1% compared to the existing recommendation system.


## A short description of CART:

- We propose a state-of-the-art kiosk recommendation system (CART) that utilizes self-supervised learning techniques tailored to kiosks in an offline retail environment. The model effectively captures user behavior and contextual information to enhance the item recommendation
performance and learning efficiency.
- The proposed CART model demonstrated a significant improvement in performance metrics, outperforming existing sequential recommendation systems. Specifically, it exhibits a 28.8% improvement in MAP @3 and a decrease in standard deviation by 0.069 when compared to Albert4rec. Furthermore, the model achieves a 0.088 improvement in HIT @10 and a 0.015 improvement in NDCG@10.
- We present hypotheses concerning various locations for kiosk recommendation systems and validate their effectiveness in constructing efficient recommendation systems for the offline retail market. The experimental results substantiate the potential of our proposed methods for addressing the challenges faced by kiosk recommendation systems in diverse environments.
